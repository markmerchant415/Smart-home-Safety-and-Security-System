# Smart-home-Safety-and-Security-System

Incidents like thefts, fire and LPG gas leakage are very common these days. What is uncommon, is people’s awareness about different systems like a smoke detector, gas leakage detectors, etc. Here, we have designed an integrated home security system that would help people secure their houses from such incidents. IOT and NodeMCU based Home Security System project is designed to help an individual secure his/her house from theft, fire and LPG gas leakage – all in one. This project uses four different sensors, from which data is sent over a website through IOT.
